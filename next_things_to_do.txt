Yes, âœ… **you can have more than one admin** in Django.

### ðŸ”‘ What makes a user an admin?

A user is considered an "admin" if they have:

* `is_superuser = True` â†’ full permissions
* `is_staff = True` â†’ access to Django admin panel (`/admin`)

You can set these for **multiple users**, so multiple admins can exist.

---

### ðŸ§± How to create multiple admins:

#### Option 1: Create multiple superusers

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Run it as many times as needed to create different admin accounts.

#### Option 2: Promote existing users

In the Django shell:

```bash
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

user = User.objects.get(username='example1')
user.is_superuser = True
user.is_staff = True
user.save()
```

Repeat this for any other users you want to promote.

---

### ðŸ§  Things to Keep in Mind

* All superusers have **full control** â€” including the ability to delete users, change devices, view logs, etc.
* Use this power carefully â€” especially in production.

Let me know if you'd like to add a feature where only superusers can **add or promote other admins** via the UI.
